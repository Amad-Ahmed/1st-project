This project is a spam scanner application created in C lanuage. I used the win32 Api to develop a graphical user interface for the application.
The application allows the user to enter plain text which was in the spam mail received by the user in the application window.
It then scans the text for the trigger words in the mail which are most commonly found in Spam mails.
It involves dynamic memory allocation as well.
